# Gesture-Surf-Effortless-Web-Exploration

The aim of a "Gesture surf :Effortless Web Exploration" project is to develop a system that allows users to interact with a web browser using hand gestures captured by a camera. The primary goal is to create a seamless and intuitive method for navigating web content without the need for traditional input devices like a mouse or keyboard.
